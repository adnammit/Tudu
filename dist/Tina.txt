This is like watching two monkeys at the puberty zoo.
There is one place I like to go. The boys' locker room. You can only see up to their ankles. I want a dry erase board so I can write down all my private thoughts and then erase them immediately. If I were a hamburger you'd come and watch! I didn't know our county was bi. Good for us. This is such a snore-gasm. I had no idea there was so much butt touching in baseball. My boob?

Good for us. Give them ridiculous French accents. Our toaster is also confused. It doesn't know where bagels go. I know how the shark thinks. It's confused. It doesn't know why we want to kill it. It just wants to go home. Detention is no big deal. Don't have a crap attack. Jimmy Jr. had a chance to ride the Tina truck, but now it's headed straight for Joshville. Toot-toot. Dear God, this is Tina from school. Suddenly, Tina Belcher appeared in the doorway. She knew what she had to do.

Hi boys. I'm Tina.
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Gene, you saved us. I owe you my life. I had no idea there was so much butt touching in baseball. Our toaster is also confused. It doesn't know where bagels go. Hey, you don't want to mess with my sister. She'll wear down your self esteem over a period of years. Tina reached towards Jimmy Junior's butt: 'Your lips say no but your butt says yes.' How do you know a python ate it? Did it leave a note? Hey Jimmy Jr. Did you see those two squirrels fighting in the courtyard?
