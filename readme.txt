TUDU TASK MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE

Tudu is a simple GUI task management program. A user logs in and creates a
list of tasks which may be classified as 'to do', 'in progress' or 
'complete'. For your enjoyment, the interface is also equipped with 
several different colorscheme options.

Tudu was written with Java using Swing for the visual components. This 
project was also a demonstration of program design, and as such the 
'documentation' directory contains three technical documents outlining the
design flow for Tudu.

User data persists through multiple sessions -- on startup, a user is
asked to create a profile or log in to an existing one. For demonstration
purposes, the user's data is saved in a <name>.txt file, with a master 
list of all users and passwords in a Users.txt file. 


RUNNING TUDU:

After extracting or downloading all files, navigate to the 'dist' 
directory and run the following command:
    $ java -jar "Tudu_2.jar" 

That's it!


FUTURE DEVELOPMENT: 
Ideally, Tudu would serve as a web app and mobile device so it can serve
in several different aspects of users' lives. Obviously, user data would
need to be secured rather than being stored in a txt file, and also I 
would like the changes to be responsive and instant, saving as the data
is altered, rather than requiring that the user hit a 'save' button.



Thank you, I hope you enjoy my silly program!
