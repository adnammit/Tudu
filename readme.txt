TUDU TASK MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE

Tudu is a simple GUI task management program. A user logs in and creates a
list of tasks which may be classified as 'to do', 'in progress' or 
'complete'. For your enjoyment, the interface is also equipped with 
several different colorscheme options.

Tudu was written with Java using Swing for the visual components. This 
project was also a demonstration of program design, and as such the 
'documentation' directory contains three technical documents outlining the
design flow for Tudu.

User data persists through multiple sessions -- on startup, a user is
asked to create a profile or log in to an existing one. For demonstration
purposes, the user's data is saved in a <name>.txt file, with a master 
list of all users and passwords in a Users.txt file.
